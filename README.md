# Clinical Data Science

These are the assignments I completed as part of Coursera's [Clinical Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/clinical-data-science) using R and Google BigQuery. The course is based on an anonymized subset of the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database. It stores de-identified data for patients treated in the critical care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
